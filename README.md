# alfred-workflow-symbol-bars
Very simple alfred workflow that paste one of the symbols in {#, *, -, =, %} N times.

I sometimes find i various programming languages (or just LaTeX)Â that I want to make a visual distinction between blocks of code. A quick an easy way to do this is with this workflow:

```
#bar N
*bar N
-bar N
=bar N
%bar N
```
